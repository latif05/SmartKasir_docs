SmartKasir Flutter app (scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal Flutter scaffold created for the SmartKasir project. It includes a tiny `main.dart` and dependencies for local SQLite testing (`sqflite`).

To run:

- Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and on PATH
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Run `flutter run` (or open in VS Code / Android Studio)
